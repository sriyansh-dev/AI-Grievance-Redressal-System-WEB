# AI-Powered Citizen Grievance Redressal System (Web Version)

## Overview

The AI-Powered Citizen Grievance Redressal System (CGRS) is a single-page web application developed for the **IBM Hackathon Prarambh 2025**, organized by IBM, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU), and the Government of Uttar Pradesh. This system addresses the **AI-Powered Citizen Grievance Redressal System** use case, contributing to the 'AI City in Lucknow' initiative by enabling citizens to submit, track, and resolve grievances efficiently. It leverages AI to automate complaint classification, prioritization, and routing, enhancing public service delivery across urban and rural areas.

The web version is designed for accessibility, supporting multilingual input, real-time tracking, and secure data handling. It is optimized for scalability and ease of deployment, making it suitable for both small-scale pilots and potential nationwide adoption.

## Features

- **Citizen Portal**: A React.js-based interface with a multilingual chatbot for submitting and tracking grievances.
- **AI Backend**:
  - NLP-based classification using BERT for categorizing complaints (e.g., infrastructure, healthcare).
  - Prioritization with rule-based and machine learning models.
  - Fake-report detection using anomaly detection algorithms.
  - Automated routing to relevant government departments.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Allows authorities to monitor and manage grievances via WebSockets.
- **Multilingual Support**: Processes complaints in Hindi, Urdu, and other regional languages.
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption and compliance with data protection regulations.
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based architecture for handling high complaint volumes.

## Problem Statement

The CGRS addresses inefficiencies in traditional grievance redressal systems, such as delays, manual errors, and lack of transparency. By integrating AI, it aims to:
- Reduce resolution times from weeks to days or hours.
- Improve accuracy in complaint categorization and routing.
- Enhance accessibility for diverse linguistic groups.
- Foster trust through transparent tracking and audit trails.

   - Build and deploy with Docker:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

## Usage

1. **Citizen Interface**:
   - Access the web app at `http://localhost:3000` or the deployed URL.
   - Use the chatbot or form to submit grievances in preferred languages.
   - Track grievance status with a unique ticket ID provided upon submission.

2. **Authority Dashboard**:
   - Access at `http://localhost:3000/admin` (requires RBAC credentials).
   - View real-time metrics, prioritize grievances, and assign tasks to departments.

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/grievances`: Submit a new grievance (e.g., `{"text": "Pothole on Main Street", "language": "en"}`).
   - `GET /api/grievances/{id}`: Retrieve grievance status.
   - `POST /api/classify`: Internal endpoint for AI classification and routing.

## AI Models

- **Classification**: [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert) for categorizing grievances into types (e.g., infrastructure, healthcare).
- **Prioritization**: Random Forest to flag urgent issues based on keywords and metadata.
- **Fake-Report Detection**: Isolation Forest for identifying spam or malicious submissions.
- **NLP**: Multilingual BERT (e.g., `bert-base-multilingual-cased`) for processing complaints in Hindi, Urdu, and other regional languages.

Training data includes synthetic datasets and hackathon-provided samples, with plans to integrate real-world grievance data during pilots.

## Deployment Challenges

- **Scalability**: Ensure cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP) handles high complaint volumes using auto-scaling groups.
- **Multilingual NLP**: Fine-tune models for low-resource languages like Bhojpuri or Awadhi.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Regularly audit AI outputs to prevent urban bias in prioritization.
- **Security**: Implement AES-256 encryption and GDPR-compliant data handling.
- **Low-Bandwidth Access**: Optimize frontend for 2G/3G networks in rural areas.
